# Archived Legacy Files

This directory contains legacy files that were part of the original DJ Desktop App implementation before it was refactored to use a proper MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.

## Archived Files:

### Legacy UI Components:
- `MainComponent.cpp/h` - Old main component, replaced by `View/MainView.cpp/h`
- `DeckGUI.cpp/h` - Old deck interface, replaced by `View/DeckView.cpp/h`
- `PlaylistComponent.cpp/h` - Old playlist component, replaced by `View/PlaylistView.cpp/h`
- `WaveformDisplay.cpp/h` - Old waveform display, replaced by `Components/WaveformView.cpp/h`
- `VerticalGradientMeter.cpp/h` - Old VU meter, replaced by `Components/VUMeter.cpp/h`
- `ButtonCellComponent.cpp/h` - Old button component, replaced by `Components/ModernButton.cpp/h`

### Legacy Audio Components:
- `DJAudioPlayer.cpp/h` - Old audio player, functionality moved to `Model/AudioEngine.cpp/h`
- `DJDisk.cpp/h` - Old disk component, functionality integrated into new MVC structure

## Why These Files Were Archived:

1. **Code Organization**: The application was refactored to follow MVC architecture patterns
2. **Maintainability**: New structure separates concerns better (Model, View, Controller)
3. **Modern Design**: New components use modern JUCE patterns and better UI design
4. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated redundant and overlapping functionality

## Current Active Structure:

- `Model/` - Data and business logic (Track, AudioEngine, PlaylistManager)
- `View/` - User interface components (MainView, DeckView, MixerView, PlaylistView)
- `Controller/` - Application logic and coordination (DJController)
- `Components/` - Reusable UI components (ModernButton, ModernSlider, WaveformView, etc.)

These archived files can be safely deleted if the new implementation is working correctly and no functionality is missing.
