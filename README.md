## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **macOS**: 10.13 or later
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 18.04+ or equivalent

### Development Requirements
- JUCE Framework (included)
- C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.15+ or Xcode (macOS)
- Audio interface (recommended for professional use)

## Building the Project

### macOS (Xcode)

1. Navigate to the build directory:
   ```bash
   cd Builds/MacOSX
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild -project thisMightWork.xcodeproj -scheme "thisMightWork - App" -configuration Release
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   open build/Release/NewProject.app
   ```

### Cross-Platform (CMake)

1. Create build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

2. Configure and build:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## Project Structure

- **`Source/`** - Main application source code
- **`Builds/`** - Platform-specific build configurations
- **`JuceLibraryCode/`** - JUCE framework integration
- **`Archive/`** - Legacy components (archived during refactoring)
- **`CMakeLists.txt`** - CMake build configuration
- **`DJ GUI_New.jucer`** - JUCE project file

## Usage

1. **Loading Tracks**: Use the playlist view to browse and load audio files
2. **Deck Control**: Each deck provides play/pause, cue, and tempo controls
3. **Mixing**: Use the mixer section to blend between tracks
4. **Jog Wheels**: Click and drag for precise track positioning
5. **Waveform**: Visual representation helps with beat matching

## Development

### Code Style
- Follow JUCE coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Maintain separation of concerns (MVC pattern)
- Document complex algorithms and audio processing code

### Adding New Features
1. Determine the appropriate layer (Model/View/Controller)
2. Create new components in the `Components/` directory if reusable
3. Update the controller to handle new business logic
4. Ensure proper memory management for audio buffers

## Audio Considerations

- **Latency**: Optimized for low-latency audio processing
- **Buffer Sizes**: Configurable audio buffer sizes for different hardware
- **Sample Rates**: Supports standard sample rates (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz)
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit and 24-bit audio support

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- Ensure JUCE modules are properly linked
- Check that all archived files are excluded from build
- Verify audio driver compatibility

### Audio Issues
- Check audio device settings in system preferences
- Ensure exclusive audio device access
- Adjust buffer sizes for your hardware
